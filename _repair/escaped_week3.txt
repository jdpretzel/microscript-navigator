# Inpatient Insulin Management Principles

## Clinical Setup
A 68-year-old man with type 2 diabetes is admitted for community-acquired pneumonia. On the second hospital day, his fasting blood glucose ranges from 200-240 mg/dL despite receiving a sliding-scale insulin regimen. What evidence-based strategy should be used to manage his inpatient glycemic control?

## Teaching Objectives
- Identify appropriate glycemic targets and treatment thresholds for non-critical hospitalized patients.
- Apply basal-bolus insulin regimens instead of sliding-scale therapy to improve outcomes.

## Teaching Points
1. Glycemic targets in non-critical inpatients are generally 100-180 mg/dL; treating mild elevations below 100 mg/dL may increase hypoglycemia without benefit. [Ref 3] Therapy is usually initiated if blood glucose exceeds 180 mg/dL on two occasions or exceeds 200 mg/dL once. [Ref 2]
2. Randomized trials comparing basal-bolus regimens with sliding-scale insulin found better glycemic control and fewer complications: mean daily glucose ~145 mg/dL versus 172 mg/dL and reduced composite complications (odds ratio 3.39) in the basal-bolus group. [Ref 1] Basal-bolus therapy uses a long-acting basal component plus scheduled prandial insulin with supplemental correction.
3. Sliding-scale insulin alone provides only reactive correction; it results in greater glycemic variability and is associated with increased infections and complications. [Ref 1] A basal-bolus regimen anticipates insulin needs and maintains steady background insulin.
4. Guidelines, including the ADA Standards of Care, endorse basal-bolus therapy and discourage sole reliance on sliding scales. [Ref 3]

## Key Numbers
- Target range for most non-critical inpatients: 100-180 mg/dL (5.6-10.0 mmol/L). [Ref 3]
- Basal-bolus trial: mean glucose 145 mg/dL vs 172 mg/dL with sliding scale; composite complications reduced (OR 3.39). [Ref 1]
- Initiate insulin therapy when blood glucose exceeds 180 mg/dL on two readings or exceeds 200 mg/dL once. [Ref 3]

## Common Pitfall
Relying solely on sliding-scale insulin can lead to reactive dosing, wide glucose swings and increased infectious complications. Transitioning to a scheduled basal-bolus regimen with correction doses improves glycemic control and reduces complications. [Ref 1]

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Board questions often compare sliding-scale to basal-bolus regimens. At the bedside, using a basal-bolus approach ensures steady basal insulin with scheduled prandial coverage; adjust doses daily based on nutritional intake and renal function. Patients with poor oral intake may require basal plus correction only.

# DKA vs HHS: Key Differences in Management

## Clinical Setup
A 54-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents with polyuria and altered mentation. Her laboratory values show serum glucose 760 mg/dL, bicarbonate 10 mEq/L, pH 7.15 and moderate ketonuria. How do diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) differ in pathophysiology and management?

## Teaching Objectives
- Distinguish diagnostic criteria for DKA versus HHS.
- Outline major differences in fluid resuscitation, insulin initiation and monitoring for DKA versus HHS.

## Teaching Points
1. Diagnosis: DKA is characterized by blood glucose ≥250 mg/dL with metabolic acidosis (pH ≤7.3, bicarbonate ≤15 mEq/L) and moderate ketonuria or ketonemia. [Ref 1] HHS presents with glucose >600 mg/dL, minimal ketones, pH >7.3 and bicarbonate >15 mEq/L. Serum osmolality is usually >320 mOsm/kg in HHS. [Ref 2]
2. Fluid resuscitation: DKA often requires rapid isotonic saline boluses (15-20 mL/kg) followed by 0.45 % saline and early insulin therapy. [Ref 1] HHS patients have profound fluid deficits (100-220 mL/kg) and benefit from cautious, gradual resuscitation with 0.9 % saline; a fixed-rate insulin infusion should start only once osmolality stops rising. Rapid correction of hyperosmolarity increases risk of cerebral edema. [Ref 2]
3. Insulin therapy: DKA management uses regular insulin 0.1 U/kg IV bolus followed by 0.1 U/kg/h infusion (or continuous 0.14 U/kg/h without bolus). Insulin should be withheld if serum potassium is <3.5 mEq/L until potassium replacement. [Ref 1] In HHS, insulin infusion (0.05-0.1 U/kg/h) begins after initial fluids, and dextrose is added when glucose <250-300 mg/dL. [Ref 2]
4. Monitoring and resolution: DKA is considered resolved when glucose <200 mg/dL plus two of the following: bicarbonate ≥15 mEq/L, pH >7.3 and anion gap ≤12. [Ref 1, 3] HHS resolution includes osmolality <300 mOsm/kg, urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg/h, improved mental status and blood glucose <250-300 mg/dL. [Ref 2]

## Key Numbers
- DKA diagnostic threshold: blood glucose ≥250 mg/dL with pH ≤7.3 and bicarbonate ≤15 mEq/L. [Ref 1]
- HHS diagnostic threshold: blood glucose >600 mg/dL with pH >7.3 and bicarbonate >15 mEq/L; fluid deficit 100-220 mL/kg requiring gradual replacement. [Ref 2]
- Insulin regimen in DKA: 0.1 U/kg IV bolus then 0.1 U/kg/h infusion, or 0.14 U/kg/h continuous; add dextrose when glucose 200-250 mg/dL and reduce insulin to 0.05 U/kg/h. [Ref 1]

## Common Pitfall
Treating HHS like DKA by initiating insulin without adequate fluid resuscitation can worsen circulatory collapse. [Ref 2] Conversely, correcting osmolality too quickly in HHS may precipitate cerebral edema. [Ref 2]

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Exams test recognition of DKA versus HHS and proper sequencing of therapy. At the bedside, confirm diagnosis with venous blood gas and basic metabolic panel, replace fluids aggressively for DKA but cautiously for HHS, and monitor electrolytes and mental status closely. Always correct potassium and measure serum osmolality to guide therapy.

# Hypoglycemia Workup in Non-Diabetics

## Clinical Setup
A 42-year-old otherwise healthy woman presents with episodic confusion, tremors and diaphoresis that improve after drinking juice. During one episode, her venous glucose is 48 mg/dL. She denies diabetes or medication use. How should her hypoglycemia be evaluated?

## Teaching Objectives
- Recognize Whipple’s triad and define hypoglycemia thresholds prompting evaluation.
- Outline the diagnostic workup for recurrent hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients.

## Teaching Points
1. Definition and triad: Hypoglycemia in adults is defined as plasma glucose <55 mg/dL. Evaluation is triggered when Whipple’s triad is present: symptoms of hypoglycemia, a low plasma glucose, and resolution of symptoms with glucose administration. [Ref 1]
2. Initial workup: Obtain critical sample labs during a spontaneous or provoked episode: serum glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, cortisol, liver function tests, renal function, and sulfonylurea screen. Elevated insulin and C-peptide with a negative sulfonylurea screen suggest endogenous hyperinsulinemia (e.g., insulinoma). [Ref 1]
3. Provocative testing: If episodes are intermittent, a supervised 72-hour fast is the gold standard for diagnosing endogenous hyperinsulinism; [Ref 1] periodic blood draws during the fast assess insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin. Alternative tests include mixed-meal tolerance for postprandial hypoglycemia.
4. Imaging and further evaluation: Once biochemical evidence of endogenous hyperinsulinism is obtained, imaging (endoscopic ultrasound, MRI, CT) localizes pancreatic tumors. [Ref 1] Consider cortisol, growth hormone or IGF-II-secreting tumors in non-insulin-mediated hypoglycemia.

## Key Numbers
- Hypoglycemia threshold: venous glucose <55 mg/dL triggers evaluation. [Ref 1]
- 72-hour fast: confirm insulinoma by demonstrating inappropriately elevated insulin and C-peptide during hypoglycemia. [Ref 1]
- Elevated insulin and C-peptide with a negative sulfonylurea screen indicates endogenous hyperinsulinism. [Ref 1]

## Teaching Pearl
Medications are a common cause of hypoglycemia. Always review the patient’s medication list and screen serum/urine for sulfonylureas and insulin analogs before embarking on extensive tumor workup.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Boards may present Whipple’s triad and ask which lab to order. At the bedside, ensure symptoms and glucose are documented simultaneously. Draw a critical sample before giving glucose; failure to obtain labs during an episode is a common diagnostic delay.

# Inpatient Insulin Transitions: IV to Subcutaneous

## Clinical Setup
A 60-year-old man with type 1 diabetes is admitted for DKA and treated with an insulin infusion. His anion gap has closed and glucose is 160 mg/dL. How should he be transitioned safely from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin?

## Teaching Objectives
- Describe principles of transitioning from IV insulin infusion to subcutaneous insulin.
- Calculate subcutaneous dosing and overlap time to prevent recurrence of DKA or hyperglycemia.

## Teaching Points
1. Overlap: Guidelines recommend continuing intravenous insulin for 2-4 hours after administering the first subcutaneous dose [Ref 1, 4] to maintain adequate insulin levels and prevent relapse. Never stop the infusion immediately after the subcutaneous injection. [Ref 1]
2. Dose calculation: Estimate the patient’s total daily insulin requirement based on insulin infusion rates over the preceding 6-8 hours. Give approximately 80 % of this total as subcutaneous insulin for the first 24 hours; divide half as basal (e.g., glargine) and half as prandial insulin with meals. [Ref 2]
3. Type of insulin: Use long-acting basal analogs such as glargine or detemir for basal coverage. [Ref 3] Rapid-acting analogs (lispro, aspart) or regular insulin should cover meals and correction doses.
4. Monitoring: Check capillary glucose every 2-4 hours after transition and adjust prandial doses daily. If the patient is not eating, basal plus correctional insulin may suffice. [Ref 3]

## Key Numbers
- Overlap of IV and subcutaneous insulin: at least 2 hours (preferably 2-4 hours). [Ref 1]
- Initial subcutaneous dose: 80 % of total daily insulin requirement based on infusion; half as basal and half divided before meals. [Ref 2]
- Reduce infusion rate when blood glucose falls to 200-250 mg/dL and add dextrose while continuing insulin until transition. [Ref 3]

## Common Pitfall
Stopping IV insulin when the anion gap closes without providing basal insulin leads to recurrence of ketosis and hyperglycemia. Ensure appropriate overlap and dosing to prevent rebound DKA. [Ref 1]

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
On exams, expect questions calculating subcutaneous doses from IV insulin requirements. At the bedside, review the infusion chart to estimate total daily insulin usage. Confirm the patient’s nutritional status and choose basal/bolus or basal plus correction regimen accordingly.

# Steroid-Induced Hyperglycemia Management

## Clinical Setup
A 55-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis is started on prednisone 40 mg daily for a flare. Two days later her capillary glucose readings are 220-260 mg/dL despite no history of diabetes. What strategies can prevent and manage steroid-induced hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients?

## Teaching Objectives
- Recognize when to initiate insulin for glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia.
- Implement titration strategies for basal and prandial insulin during and after steroid therapy.

## Teaching Points
1. Recognition: Glucocorticoids increase hepatic gluconeogenesis and cause peripheral insulin resistance. [Ref 1] Hyperglycemia typically occurs 4-8 hours after steroid administration and often peaks in the afternoon or evening. [Ref 1] Monitoring should begin at initiation of therapy.
2. Initiation and dosing: Initiate insulin if a single capillary glucose exceeds 15 mmol/L (≈270 mg/dL) or two readings exceed 12 mmol/L (≈216 mg/dL). Use basal (isophane or glargine) insulin 0.4 U/kg with steroid administration and add rapid-acting insulin 0.1 U/kg at meals. For patients with pre-existing diabetes, increase total daily insulin dose by 10-30 % when steroids begin. [Ref 2]
3. Titration: Adjust insulin doses every 24-48 hours: increase total daily dose by 10-30 % if hyperglycemia persists or decrease by 10-30 % if hypoglycemia occurs. [Ref 2] When steroid doses are tapered, reduce insulin by 25-50 % to prevent hypoglycemia. [Ref 2]
4. Alternative agents: For mild hyperglycemia or outpatient management, consider adjusting oral diabetes medications. Nonetheless, insulin remains the safest and most flexible strategy in hospitalized patients. [Ref 3]

## Key Numbers
- Initiate insulin when one glucose exceeds 15 mmol/L (≈270 mg/dL) or two exceed 12 mmol/L (≈216 mg/dL). [Ref 1]
- Starting basal insulin: 0.4 U/kg at steroid administration plus 0.1 U/kg rapid-acting insulin with meals. [Ref 2]
- Titrate insulin by 10-30 % every 24-48 hours; reduce by 25-50 % when tapering steroids. [Ref 2]

## Teaching Pearl
Glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia often resolves quickly once steroids are discontinued. Plan ahead: reduce insulin dose as the steroid is tapered to avoid late-onset hypoglycemia.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Exam questions may ask which insulin regimen to start for a patient on high-dose steroids. Clinically, monitor pre-meal and bedtime glucose, anticipate afternoon spikes, and involve endocrinology for complex cases.

# Thyroid Storm: Recognition and Initial Management

## Clinical Setup
A 30-year-old woman with known Graves disease presents with fever, agitation, tachycardia (heart rate 150 bpm) and vomiting after discontinuing antithyroid medications. Laboratory testing shows suppressed TSH and markedly elevated free T4. How do you recognize and treat thyroid storm?

## Teaching Objectives
- Identify clinical features distinguishing thyroid storm from uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis.
- Describe a multi-modal management strategy for thyroid storm.

## Teaching Points
1. Recognition: Thyroid storm is a life-threatening exacerbation of thyrotoxicosis characterized by hyperthermia, tachyarrhythmias, CNS agitation or delirium, vomiting and multi-organ dysfunction. [Ref 1] Common precipitants include infection, surgery, trauma and medication non-adherence. [Ref 2]
2. Antithyroid drugs: Begin propylthiouracil (PTU) 600-1 000 mg loading dose followed by 200-250 mg every 4 hours (total 1 200-1 500 mg/day), or methimazole 40 mg loading followed by 25 mg every 4 hours (total 120 mg/day). PTU additionally inhibits peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 [Ref 1].
3. Iodine therapy: Give iodine (Lugol’s solution 8-10 drops every 6-8 hours or saturated potassium iodide 5 drops every 6 hours) at least one hour after antithyroid drugs to block hormone release. [Ref 2]
4. Beta-adrenergic blockade: Administer propranolol 20-120 mg orally every 6 hours or 1-2 mg IV (repeat every 10-15 minutes as needed) to control tachycardia; alternatively, esmolol 500 μg/kg bolus followed by 50-200 μg/kg/min continuous infusion. [Ref 1, 2]
5. Glucocorticoids and supportive care: Give hydrocortisone 100 mg IV followed by 100 mg every 8 hours or dexamethasone 2 mg IV every 6 hours to reduce peripheral T4→T3 conversion and treat relative adrenal insufficiency. [Ref 2] Provide aggressive cooling, IV fluids, and treat precipitating causes. [Ref 1]

## Key Numbers
- PTU: 600-1 000 mg loading then 200-250 mg every 4 hours (1 200-1 500 mg/day). [Ref 2]
- Methimazole: 40 mg loading then 25 mg every 4 hours (total 120 mg/day). [Ref 2]
- Hydrocortisone: 100 mg IV then 100 mg every 8 hours or dexamethasone 2 mg IV every 6 hours. [Ref 2]

## Common Pitfall
Administering iodine before antithyroid drugs can increase hormone synthesis through the Jod-Basedow phenomenon. Always give PTU or methimazole first and wait at least one hour before iodine.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Boards may ask about the sequence of therapies: beta-blocker, antithyroid drug, iodine, glucocorticoids and supportive care. Clinically, early recognition and rapid initiation of these therapies are critical; monitor for arrhythmias and treat underlying precipitants.

# Myxedema Coma: Recognition and Initial Management

## Clinical Setup
An 82-year-old woman with long-standing hypothyroidism presents with confusion, hypothermia (core temperature 34 °C), bradycardia and hypotension after a winter storm caused her to miss medications. She is obtunded with dry, coarse skin. How should myxedema coma be recognized and managed?

## Teaching Objectives
- Recognize clinical features of myxedema coma and necessary diagnostic studies.
- Initiate appropriate thyroid hormone and adrenal support while providing supportive care.

## Teaching Points
1. Recognition: Myxedema coma is severe decompensated hypothyroidism presenting with altered mental status, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoventilation and hyponatremia. [Ref 1] It often occurs in elderly patients with long-standing hypothyroidism precipitated by infection, cold exposure or medication non-adherence. [Ref 1]
2. Initial evaluation: Obtain serum TSH, free T4, free T3 and random cortisol before treatment. [Ref 2] Hypoglycemia and hyponatremia should be corrected immediately; respiratory failure is common. [Ref 1]
3. Hormone replacement: Give IV levothyroxine loading dose 200-400 μg followed by maintenance 1.6 μg/kg/day (reduce to 75 % of the calculated oral dose because IV administration bypasses absorption). Consider liothyronine 5-20 μg IV loading then 2.5-10 μg every 8 hours if there is no response within 24 hours. [Ref 2]
4. Adrenal support: Administer hydrocortisone 100 mg IV immediately followed by 200-400 mg per day until adrenal insufficiency is excluded. [Ref 2]
5. Supportive care: Passive rewarming, mechanical ventilation if needed, and treatment of precipitating factors (infection, myocardial infarction) are critical. [Ref 1] Avoid rapid active rewarming which may precipitate vasodilation and shock. [Ref 1]

## Key Numbers
- Levothyroxine loading: 200-400 μg IV; maintenance 1.6 μg/kg/day at 75 % of calculated oral dose. [Ref 2]
- Hydrocortisone: 100 mg IV bolus then 200-400 mg/day until adrenal insufficiency is excluded. [Ref 2]
- Mortality of myxedema coma: 20-60 %, underscoring the need for prompt treatment. [Ref 1]

## Common Pitfall
Failure to provide empiric hydrocortisone may result in unrecognized adrenal insufficiency and hemodynamic collapse. Always administer stress-dose corticosteroids before thyroid hormone in suspected myxedema coma.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Boards may test the order of therapy. At the bedside, treat empirically without waiting for laboratory results, monitor for arrhythmias and respiratory failure, and lower thyroid hormone doses in elderly or cardiac patients to reduce risk of myocardial ischemia.

# Adrenal Insufficiency: Recognition and Stress Dosing

## Clinical Setup
A 35-year-old woman with known Addison disease develops vomiting and abdominal pain after a gastrointestinal illness. She is hypotensive with systolic blood pressure 85 mmHg, hyponatremic and hyperkalemic. What constitutes an adrenal crisis, and how should stress dosing be managed?

## Teaching Objectives
- Recognize clinical features of adrenal crisis and precipitating factors.
- Implement acute treatment and stress-dose corticosteroid regimens.

## Teaching Points
1. Recognition: Adrenal crisis presents with hypotension refractory to fluids, hypovolemia, abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. [Ref 1] Precipitating factors include infection, trauma, surgery or abrupt withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy. [Ref 2]
2. Acute treatment: Immediately administer hydrocortisone 100 mg IV or IM bolus followed by 200 mg over 24 hours via continuous infusion or 50 mg IV/IM every 6 hours. Rapidly infuse 1 L of isotonic saline within the first hour and provide 4-6 L over 24 hours to restore volume and correct hypotension. [Ref 2]
3. Stress dosing: For mild stress (febrile illness), patients should double their usual oral glucocorticoid dose. For major stress (surgery, trauma), they should receive 100 mg hydrocortisone IM/IV followed by continuous 200 mg/day infusion and resume oral dosing when stable. [Ref 2]
4. Tapering: After 24-72 hours, taper hydrocortisone to maintenance dosing and introduce mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone) once the hydrocortisone dose falls below 50 mg/day. [Ref 2]

## Key Numbers
- Hydrocortisone bolus: 100 mg IV/IM; maintenance: 200 mg/24 h (continuous or 50 mg every 6 hours). [Ref 2]
- Fluid resuscitation: 1 L isotonic saline in first hour; 4-6 L over 24 hours. [Ref 1]
- For minor illness, double usual oral glucocorticoid dose; for major stress, 100 mg hydrocortisone plus 200 mg/day infusion. [Ref 1, 2]

## Common Pitfall
Delaying steroid administration while awaiting confirmatory tests can be fatal. In suspected adrenal crisis, treat empirically with hydrocortisone and fluids immediately.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Board questions emphasize acute management and stress dosing. Clinically, instruct patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency to carry emergency hydrocortisone and educate them on sick-day rules.

# Approach to the Incidental Thyroid Nodule

## Clinical Setup
A 45-year-old woman undergoes carotid Doppler ultrasound for transient ischemic attack and is incidentally found to have a 1.6-cm solid, hypoechoic thyroid nodule. Her thyroid function tests are normal. What is the recommended approach for evaluating such nodules?

## Teaching Objectives
- Outline the initial evaluation of incidental thyroid nodules, including laboratory and imaging steps.
- Apply size- and risk-based criteria for fine-needle aspiration (FNA).

## Teaching Points
1. Initial assessment: Measure serum TSH in all patients. [Ref 2] If TSH is low, obtain a radionuclide scan to assess for autonomous function. [Ref 2] Perform high-resolution ultrasound to evaluate nodule size, composition, echogenicity, shape and cervical lymph nodes. [Ref 1]
2. Ultrasound risk stratification: High-risk features (hypoechoic, irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape) warrant a lower FNA threshold. [Ref 2] Low-risk features include spongiform or purely cystic nodules. [Ref 1]
3. FNA criteria: FNA is recommended for nodules ≥1 cm with intermediate/high suspicion, ≥1.5 cm with low suspicion and ≥2 cm with very low suspicion. [Ref 2] FNA is not generally indicated for purely cystic or sub-centimeter nodules unless there are high-risk history or suspicious lymph nodes. [Ref 2]
4. Follow-up: Nodules that do not meet FNA criteria should undergo periodic ultrasound surveillance (e.g., at 6-12 months initially). [Ref 2] Consider molecular testing or referral to endocrinology for indeterminate cytology. [Ref 1]

## Key Numbers
- FNA size thresholds: ≥1 cm (intermediate/high suspicion); ≥1.5 cm (low suspicion); ≥2 cm (very low suspicion). [Ref 2]
- Suppressed TSH warrants radionuclide scan; normal or elevated TSH indicates ultrasound and FNA triage. [Ref 2]
- High-risk ultrasound features: hypoechoic, irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape. [Ref 2]

## Teaching Pearl
Risk stratification using ultrasound patterns helps avoid unnecessary biopsies. Purely cystic nodules and spongiform lesions have very low malignancy risk and can often be managed conservatively.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Board questions may provide ultrasound descriptions and ask whether FNA is indicated. In practice, obtain high-quality ultrasound and apply size and risk criteria to determine FNA versus observation.

# Pheochromocytoma: Recognition and Workup

## Clinical Setup
A 48-year-old man experiences episodic pounding headaches, profuse sweating and palpitations. Blood pressure measurements reveal paroxysmal hypertension up to 220/120 mmHg. His father underwent surgery for a catecholamine-secreting tumor. What is the appropriate diagnostic approach and preoperative management?

## Teaching Objectives
- Identify clinical features suggestive of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.
- Outline the biochemical evaluation, genetic considerations and preoperative preparation.

## Teaching Points
1. Clinical features: Persistent or paroxysmal hypertension occurs in 80-90 % of patients; the classic triad of headache, sweating and palpitations is present in approximately 25 %. [Ref 1] Symptoms may be episodic and triggered by stress, medications or position changes. Family history and syndromic features (MEN2, VHL) increase suspicion. [Ref 3]
2. Biochemical evaluation: Initial screening tests include plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines. [Ref 3] Repeat testing if high clinical suspicion persists despite negative results. Approximately 40 % of patients harbour germline mutations, so genetic counselling is recommended. [Ref 3]
3. Imaging: After biochemical confirmation, perform cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI of abdomen/pelvis) or functional imaging (MIBG or PET) to localize tumors. [Ref 3]
4. Preoperative preparation: Start alpha-adrenergic blockade at least 14 days before surgery (phenoxybenzamine 10 mg once or twice daily, titrated to 20-100 mg/day; alternatively, doxazosin 1-2 mg daily titrated upward). [Ref 2] Encourage high-sodium diet and liberal fluid intake to counteract vasodilation. Only after adequate alpha blockade should beta-blockers be added to control tachycardia. [Ref 3] Target seated BP <130/80 mmHg with standing systolic BP >90 mmHg and heart rate 60-70 bpm seated and 70-80 bpm standing. [Ref 3]

## Key Numbers
- Hypertension present in 80-90 % of patients; classic triad in ~25 %. [Ref 1]
- Germline mutations occur in ≈40 % of cases. [Ref 3]
- Phenoxybenzamine starting dose 10 mg once or twice daily, titrated to 20-100 mg/day; initiate at least 14 days pre-operatively. [Ref 2, 3]

## Common Pitfall
Starting beta-blockers before achieving adequate alpha blockade can precipitate hypertensive crisis by unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Always initiate alpha blockade first and monitor volume status.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Exams often emphasize biochemical testing (plasma free metanephrines) and preoperative alpha blockade. Clinically, counsel patients about medication adherence and fluid intake, and coordinate with genetics for familial syndromes.

# Cellulitis vs Abscess: Management Differences

## Clinical Setup
A 37-year-old man presents with a 4-cm fluctuant, tender lesion on his thigh surrounded by erythema and induration. He is afebrile and otherwise healthy. What distinguishes management of cellulitis from that of a cutaneous abscess?

## Teaching Objectives
- Differentiate cellulitis and abscess clinically and determine when systemic antibiotics are indicated.
- Understand indications for incision and drainage and adjunctive antibiotic therapy.

## Teaching Points
1. Definitions: Cellulitis is a diffuse spreading infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, usually caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or *Staphylococcus aureus*. [Ref 1] Abscesses are collections of pus within dermis or deeper tissues that create a fluctuant mass. [Ref 1]
2. Management of cellulitis: Systemic antibiotics targeting streptococci (e.g., penicillin, cephalexin) and *S. aureus* (e.g., clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) are the mainstay. [Ref 1] Incision is not required unless purulence develops. [Ref 1]
3. Management of abscess: Incision and drainage with thorough evacuation and breaking up of loculations is the primary therapy. [Ref 1] Systemic antibiotics are usually unnecessary for small, uncomplicated abscesses in immunocompetent hosts; they may be considered if there are multiple lesions, extensive surrounding cellulitis, signs of systemic infection (temperature >38.5 °C or pulse >100 bpm), immunosuppression or inadequate drainage. [Ref 1, 2]
4. Follow-up: After drainage, instruct patients to keep the wound open with packing or wicks as needed and return if signs of recurrence develop. [Ref 2] Systemic antibiotics should be limited to 24-48 hours when indicated. [Ref 1]

## Key Numbers
- Systemic antibiotics are rarely required for uncomplicated cutaneous abscesses; consider them if temperature >38.5 °C or pulse >100 bpm or if multiple lesions or immunosuppression. [Ref 1]
- Incision and drainage is the definitive treatment for most abscesses. [Ref 1]
- Contamination from incision and drainage is uncommon; bacteremia is rare. [Ref 2]

## Common Pitfall
Using antibiotics alone for an abscess without performing incision and drainage leads to treatment failure. Adequate drainage is essential.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Boards often describe a fluctuant lesion and ask for next step. At the bedside, differentiate cellulitis from abscess by palpating for fluctuance. Reserve antibiotics for cellulitis or complicated abscesses.

# Osteomyelitis: Diagnosis and Treatment Principles

## Clinical Setup
A 70-year-old man with diabetes presents with worsening low back pain and fever. He has a history of *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteremia two weeks earlier. MRI of the spine shows vertebral body marrow signal consistent with infection. How should vertebral osteomyelitis be diagnosed and treated?

## Teaching Objectives
- Describe diagnostic steps for suspected native vertebral osteomyelitis.
- Outline duration and mode of antimicrobial therapy.

## Teaching Points
1. Diagnosis: Native vertebral osteomyelitis often results from hematogenous seeding. [Ref 1] Plain radiographs are insensitive; MRI is the imaging modality of choice for early detection and to assess epidural extension. [Ref 1] Obtain blood cultures and, whenever feasible, percutaneous biopsy for microbiologic diagnosis before initiating antibiotics. [Ref 1]
2. Empiric antibiotics: Empiric antimicrobial therapy should generally be withheld until microbiologic diagnosis, except in patients with sepsis or neurologic compromise. [Ref 1] If empiric therapy is necessary, cover *S. aureus* (including MRSA), gram-negative bacilli and streptococci. [Ref 1]
3. Treatment duration: Most patients are cured with a 6-week course of pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy. [Ref 1] Randomized studies suggest that 6 weeks is non-inferior to 12 weeks, though longer courses may be needed for complicated infections or inadequate source control. [Ref 2]
4. Route of therapy: Intravenous therapy is used initially; early switch to oral therapy with highly bioavailable agents (e.g., fluoroquinolones plus rifampin) may be safe and effective. [Ref 2] Monitor inflammatory markers and clinical response to guide duration. [Ref 1]
5. Surgical indications: Consider surgical intervention for neurologic compromise, spinal instability, large abscesses or failure of medical therapy. [Ref 1]

## Key Numbers
- MRI sensitivity and specificity for vertebral osteomyelitis exceed 90 %, making it the imaging test of choice. [Ref 1]
- Recommended antimicrobial therapy duration: 6 weeks; non-inferior to 12 weeks in randomized studies. [Ref 1, 2]
- Withhold empiric antibiotics until cultures obtained unless sepsis or neurologic deficits are present. [Ref 1]

## Common Pitfall
Starting broad-spectrum antibiotics before obtaining blood cultures or biopsy may sterilize cultures and hinder diagnosis. Obtain samples first whenever possible.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Exams may test when to withhold antibiotics and appropriate treatment duration. Clinically, coordinate with radiology and interventional radiology for biopsy, monitor CRP/ESR trends and arrange for outpatient parenteral or oral therapy.

# Infective Endocarditis: Diagnosis and Initial Management

## Clinical Setup
A 64-year-old man with a prosthetic aortic valve presents with fever and a new murmur. You suspect infective endocarditis. How should you proceed with diagnostic evaluation and empiric therapy?

## Teaching Objectives
- Outline appropriate blood culture collection and early diagnostic steps for suspected infective endocarditis.
- Summarize principles of initial antimicrobial therapy for native and prosthetic valve endocarditis.

## Teaching Points
1. Blood cultures: Obtain at least three sets of blood cultures, 10 mL each, from separate venipuncture sites at 30-minute intervals before starting antibiotics. [Ref 1, 2] Each set should include one aerobic and one anaerobic bottle. Repeat cultures 48-72 hours after starting therapy to monitor sterilization. [Ref 2]
2. Diagnostic imaging: Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) initially; transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive, particularly in prosthetic valves. [Ref 1] Modified Duke criteria aid diagnosis. [Ref 1, 2]
3. Empiric therapy: Early empiric therapy should target staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci. [Ref 2] For native valve endocarditis without prosthetic material, combination therapy with IV oxacillin (or vancomycin if MRSA or penicillin allergy) plus ceftriaxone or gentamicin may be used; avoid routine aminoglycosides for staphylococcal infections due to nephrotoxicity. [Ref 2] For prosthetic valve endocarditis, add rifampin after 3-5 days of effective therapy. [Ref 1]
4. Duration: Prolonged therapy is required; native valve endocarditis typically requires 4-6 weeks of bactericidal antibiotics from the first negative culture, and prosthetic valve endocarditis generally requires at least 6 weeks. [Ref 1, 2]
5. Additional considerations: Consult cardiology and infectious disease specialists early. Valve surgery may be necessary for heart failure, uncontrolled infection or prevention of embolism. [Ref 1]

## Key Numbers
- Draw at least three sets of blood cultures 30 minutes apart before antibiotics. [Ref 1, 2]
- Repeat cultures after 48-72 hours to ensure clearance. [Ref 2]
- Duration of therapy: 4-6 weeks for native valves; ≥6 weeks for prosthetic valves. [Ref 1, 2]

## Common Pitfall
Starting antibiotics before obtaining adequate blood cultures compromises diagnosis and may lead to culture-negative endocarditis. Always obtain cultures first.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Exams emphasize the number and timing of blood cultures and appropriate empiric therapy. At the bedside, quickly obtain cultures, involve infectious disease consultants and tailor therapy once organism and susceptibilities are known.

# Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia Considerations

## Clinical Setup
A 72-year-old man develops fever and purulent sputum on hospital day 5 after admission for hip fracture. He was receiving intravenous cefazolin for surgical prophylaxis. Chest radiograph shows a new infiltrate. How should healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) be approached?

## Teaching Objectives
- Define HAP and VAP and identify risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.
- Select empiric antibiotic regimens based on risk stratification and local resistance patterns.

## Teaching Points
1. Definitions: HAP is pneumonia occurring ≥48 hours after hospital admission, and VAP occurs ≥48 hours after endotracheal intubation. [Ref 1] The old category of health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) has been abandoned; management should focus on risk factors for MDR organisms and local antibiograms. [Ref 1]
2. Risk factors for MDR pathogens: Prior IV antibiotic use within 90 days, septic shock at onset, acute respiratory distress syndrome preceding VAP, hospitalization >5 days before pneumonia onset, and acute renal replacement therapy. [Ref 1] These factors increase the likelihood of MRSA and resistant gram-negative organisms. [Ref 1]
3. Empiric therapy (no MDR risk): For patients without MDR risk factors, choose a single anti-pseudomonal agent that also covers other gram-negative bacteria and *Staphylococcus aureus*, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem or meropenem. [Ref 1] MRSA coverage (vancomycin or linezolid) should be added only if local MRSA prevalence exceeds 10-20 % or risk factors are present. [Ref 1]
4. Empiric therapy (MDR risk): If MDR risk factors are present or local resistance to first agents exceeds 10 %, use dual anti-pseudomonal therapy from different classes (e.g., β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside) and add MRSA coverage. [Ref 1]
5. Duration and de-escalation: Treat for 7 days in most cases and de-escalate based on culture results and clinical response. [Ref 1] Shorter courses reduce adverse effects and resistance. [Ref 2]

## Key Numbers
- HAP/VAP develops ≥48 hours after hospitalization or intubation. [Ref 1]
- MDR risk factors include prior IV antibiotics within 90 days, septic shock, ARDS, hospitalization >5 days before pneumonia and renal replacement therapy. [Ref 1]
- Recommended treatment duration: 7 days. [Ref 1]

## Common Pitfall
Unnecessary broad-spectrum coverage in patients without MDR risk factors promotes antibiotic resistance. Tailor therapy to risk factors and local antibiogram.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Board questions test identification of risk factors and appropriate empiric regimens. At the bedside, use local resistance data, collect sputum cultures before antibiotics and reassess therapy daily to de-escalate when possible.

# Approach to Positive Blood Cultures

## Clinical Setup
A 58-year-old man is admitted for cellulitis. Blood cultures drawn on admission grow coagulase-negative staphylococci in one of four bottles after 72 hours. How should positive blood cultures be interpreted and managed?

## Teaching Objectives
- Distinguish contaminated blood cultures from true bloodstream infections.
- Identify organisms that always warrant treatment and necessary evaluation.

## Teaching Points
1. Contamination versus infection: Contamination rates in blood cultures should be <3 %. [Ref 3] Growth of skin commensals (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci, *Bacillus* species, *Cutibacterium acnes*) in a single bottle collected after 48-72 hours often represents contamination. [Ref 1] True infection is more likely when the same organism grows in multiple bottles, with shorter time to positivity and concordant clinical signs. [Ref 1]
2. Organisms always significant: Positive cultures for *Staphylococcus aureus*, group A streptococci, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, Enterobacteriaceae, *Bacteroides* species, *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Candida* species should be considered true bloodstream infections and treated accordingly. [Ref 1] For *S. aureus* bacteremia or candidemia, obtain echocardiography (preferably transesophageal) and ophthalmologic exam for candidemia due to risk of endocarditis and endophthalmitis. [Ref 2]
3. Evaluation strategy: Consider number of positive bottles, organism type, time to positivity, patient’s clinical status and presence of intravascular devices. Repeat blood cultures to confirm clearance; contamination typically does not persist. [Ref 1]
4. Management: If contamination is likely, communicate with the laboratory to review collection technique and avoid unnecessary antibiotics. [Ref 3] If true infection is suspected, start appropriate empiric therapy and evaluate for source control. [Ref 2]

## Key Numbers
- Target contamination rate for blood cultures: <3 %. [Ref 3]
- Repeat positive cultures after 72 hours suggest true infection; single bottle growth of skin commensals often indicates contamination. [Ref 1]
- Organisms such as *Staphylococcus aureus*, group A streptococci and *Candida* should always prompt evaluation and treatment. [Ref 1, 2]

## Teaching Pearl
When in doubt, assess the clinical context: fever, leukocytosis, hemodynamic instability and presence of indwelling catheters increase the likelihood of true bacteremia. Do not ignore positive cultures for *S. aureus* or *Candida* regardless of the number of bottles.

## Boards + Bedside Tie-In
Boards may provide culture results and ask if antibiotics are needed. At the bedside, interpret cultures with clinical judgement; avoid overtreatment of contaminants but never under-treat true infections.
